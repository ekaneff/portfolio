			<h4><a href="#" target="_blank">RecipeBox</a></h4>
			<p class="desc">For this project, I was the sole designer and developer. I was given a time line of about 24 hours to create a full CRUD application that used the database to store information through the files in an XHR file, proving I can work fast and efficiently under short deadlines. This project was my first introduction to using AJAX in order to talk to PHP files that connected to a SQL database. All interactions were made without a responsive framework, as well.

			<h4><a href="http://indie.45.55.168.213.xip.io/" target="_blank">IndieSpot.</a></h4>
			<p class="desc">Focusing mainly on layout, this site shows my strength in content flow and organization. IndieSpot was created from the general requirement of “build a website for a movie theater”. Since design was the focus, not everything on the site is functional, but the <strong>user</strong> is able to select the “Captain Fantastic” movie to see details on that film, as well as the “Quentin Tarantino Marathon” event to view details on that event. It is fully <strong>responsive</strong> and no <strong>responsive frameworks</strong> were used. I had a time line of about 48 hours to complete this project.</p>

			<h4><a href="http://music.45.55.137.79.xip.io/" target="_blank">ArtistFind</a></h4>
			<p class="desc">The requirements for this project were to create an application using at least one API that would also implement full CRUD functionality as well as common design patterns within the programming. ES6 practices were also encouraged. I was again the sole designer and developer, and the time line was about four weeks. I implemented <strong>MVC</strong> as well as <strong>custom events</strong> and <strong>event dispatching</strong> in order to handle the data received from the API. The biggest challenge I ran into while making this project was that the first API I tried to use returned invalid image URLs. This meant that I had to use one <strong>API</strong> to return to me musical artists based on genre, and then with that data I had to query another API to return new artist object with valid images. I accomplished this through various custom events that were triggered on success of each API call. This was also the first time I utilized <strong>local storage</strong> and <strong>jQuery UI</strong>.</p>
